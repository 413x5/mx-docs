## Overview

### Registering contracts

Since we don't have native execution in the Rust backend yet, the only way to run contracts is to register the contract implementation for the given contract code identifier. In simpler words, we tell the environment "whenever you encounter this contract code, run this code that I've written instead".

Since this operation is specific to only the Rust debugger, it doesn't go through the mandos pipeline.
