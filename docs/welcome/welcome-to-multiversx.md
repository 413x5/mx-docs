## **Get started with MultiversX!**

### **At a glance**

MultiversX is a [sharded](/docs/learn/sharding.md) blockchain network, with a [PoS-based consensus mechanism](/docs/learn/consensus.md). It supports [smart contracts](/docs/developers/smart-contracts.md), scales via an industry-first adaptive state sharding mechanism and is therefore capable of horizontal scaling whilst having [low-end hardware requirements](/docs/validators/system-requirements.md) for nodes.

#### **Highlights:**
 - Performance and Throughput:
   - 10,000 TPS per transaction shard
   - 30,000 current max TPS
   - 6s block time
   - $0.002 tx cost
   - can scale beyond 100,000 TPS
   - Highest TPS achieved: 263,000 in a public testnet with 50 shards in 2020
   - Full horizontal scalability
 - [xPortal](https://xportal.com) money app with progressive security, embedded DeFi, on- and off-ramps, cards and a vast array of features
 - [Tokens](/docs/developers/esdt-tokens.md) (FT, SFT, NFT) natively embedded into the protocol for maximum safety
 - [Developers](/docs/developers/overview.md):
   - Royalties: 30% SC gas returned to SC authors
   - [Full IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elrond.vscode-elrond-ide)
   - [Rust framework with debugger](/docs/developers/smart-contracts.md)
 - [Validators](/docs/validators/overview.md):
   - ~10% APR for running nodes
   - low system requirements
   - very easy to setup and run
   - one-click-setup nodes available at Google Cloud or Tencent Cloud
 - [Network setup](https://explorer.multiversx.com/validators):
   - 5000+ nodes (3200+ validator nodes)
   - 4 shards (1 Metachain, 3 transaction shards)
   - more shards can be added if needed
 - [Sovereign Chains](/docs/sovereign/Overview.md):
   - DEMO - ["voyager" sovereign chain](https://explorer.voyager1.dev/) was launched as a test sovereign chain and reached a max TPS of >77k TPS with 1s block time
   - Multi-VM - compatible with [Bitcoin](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6597cc7be68d63ec0c8ce338/664f6e01f2dd839286e20536_BitcoinX-litepaper.pdf), [Ethereum](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6597cc7be68d63ec0c8ce338/664f6e03efeeeb4e8c2efaf8_EthereumX-litepaper.pdf), [Solana](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6597cc7be68d63ec0c8ce338/664f6e026748935c069bd7a5_SolanaX-litepaper.pdf) and much more.
   - Interoperability Layer - hyper-scalable, composable and configurable technological tree designed for flexibility and interoperability. 

### **How is MultiversX different?**

The MultiversX network is the first of it's kind to present a viable solution where all three aspects of sharding, namely state, network and transactions have been fully implemented at once. Combining this with the unique "Adaptive" mechanism that allows adding or removing shards easily, this novel architecture allows the network to scale with demand whilst maintaining it's high level of security.

In addition to horizontal scaling through sharding, MultiversX also approaches the consensus problem with a mechanism called Secure Proof of Stake, which mitigates potential attack vectors when compared to Proof of Work, while also enabling large throughput and fast execution. At the same time it manages to eliminate potential security issues found in sharded networks, by randomly shuffling validators after every epoch among all shards, provably mitigating shard takeover attacks. 

By solving some of the hardest consensus and sharding problems in the blockchain space, MultiversX is able to provide a very high level of performance on a network made of inexpensive computers, resulting in a very low cost per transaction whilst maintaing high levels of security and incentivizing decentralization. In addition to performance and cost, MultiversX also stands out through the quality of the developer experience and the resulting boost in usability on the end-user side.
