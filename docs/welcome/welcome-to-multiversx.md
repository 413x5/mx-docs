## **At a glance:**

- **What**: Sharded Smart Contracts execution platform with a PoS consensus mechanism
- **When:** Mainnet live, project started in 2018
- **How:** Scales via Adaptive State Sharding, consensus via Secure Proof of Stake
- **Highlights:**
  - Performance: 30,000 current TPS, 6s block time, $0.002 tx cost, can scale beyond 100,000 (263,000 TPS in testnet)
  - xPortal money app with progressive security, social recovery, embedded DeFi, cross-chain operations
  - Tokens (FT, SFT, NFT) embedded into the protocol
  - Developers: royalties - 30% SC gas returned to authors, full VSCode IDE, Rust SC development framework with debugger
  - Validators: ~8% APR for running nodes, low system requirements
  - Network setup: 3,200 nodes, 3 shards + Metachain (adaptivity allows throughput to increase with demand)
  - Sovereign Chains: interoperability, Multi-VM (EVM, SolVM, BitVM, etc.), +80,000TPS with 1s block time, permissioned/permissionless by choice, fully configurable
