**xAlias** is a _single sign-on_ solution for Web3, powered by Google Sign-In (Web2). It allows new users (not yet proficient in blockchain technologies) to quickly and easily create blockchain wallets (without the need of seed phrases), then start right away and interact with MultiversX dApps.

It's a _self-custody_ wallet, and it's _convertible_ to a conventional Web3 wallet at a later point.

:::important
**For dApp developers:** xAlias exposes **the same [URL hooks and callbacks](/wallet/webhooks)** as the [Web Wallet](/wallet/web-wallet). Therefore, integrating xAlias is **identical to integrating the Web Wallet** (with one trivial exception: the configuration of the URL base). See [Signing Providers for dApps](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-signing-providers).
