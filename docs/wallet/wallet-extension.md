The Maiar DeFi Wallet can be installed on Chrome, Brave, and other chromium-based browsers. This extension is free and secure, with compelling features that allow you to create a new wallet or import existing wallets, manage multiple wallets on the Elrond mainnet, and store Elrond tokens such as EGLD, ESDT, or NFTs on the Elrond Network with easy accessibility.

### Create a new wallet

**Step 3:** Next, a secret phrase consisting of a set of 24 secret words will be displayed. Safely backup these secret words.

### Import existing wallet

Do you already have a wallet?

Then there is no need to create a new one. The Maiar Wallet Extension provides an option to import your existing wallet. However, to import an existing wallet you must have access to its¬†**secret (recovery) phrase**.

The Maiar wallet has a set of 24-secret phrases, which serve as your wallet‚Äôs key. Using your secret phrase to import an existing wallet does not affect your wallet, as all transaction history across all networks will be reflected in the wallet extension.

**To get started:** 

**Step 1:** With the [Maiar DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maiar-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm) installed. Click on ‚Äò‚ÄôImport existing wallet‚Äù.

**Step 2:** Next, enter your 24-word secret phrase. You can either enter these phrases one at a time or you can simply paste in the phrase using the "_paste_" icon.
