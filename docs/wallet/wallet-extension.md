title: Maiar Web Wallet Extension
---


Popularly referred to as the "future of money," Maiar DeFi Wallet now has a robust web extension. Maiar DeFi Wallet is a powerful Elrond web wallet extension that effectively automates interactions with Elrond Distributed apps and interacts with Maiar Dex. The Maiar DeFi Wallet enables users to store Elrond tokens such as EGLD and ESDT on the Elrond network.

The Maiar Defi Wallet can be installed on Chrome, Brave, and other chromium-based browsers. The extension is free and secure, with compelling features that allow users to create a new wallet or import existing wallets, manage multiple wallets on the Elrond mainnet with easy accessibility, and more.

* On the [Chrome Web Store Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), search for ***Maiar DeFi Wallet.***
