Popularly referred to as the "future of money," Maiar currently has a robust web wallet extension known as the¬†**Maiar DeFi Wallet Extension**. It is a powerful browser extension for the Elrond Wallet that effectively automates and reduces the steps and time required for users to interact with Elrond Decentralized apps.

The Maiar DeFi Wallet can be installed on Chrome, Brave, and other chromium-based browsers. This extension is free and secure, with compelling features that allow you to create a new wallet or import existing wallets, manage multiple wallets on the Elrond mainnet, and store Elrond tokens such as EGLD, ESDT, or NFTs on the Elrond Network with easy accessibility.

Let's walk through the steps how to install and set up the Maiar DeFi Wallet extension:

## Prerequisites

### Create a new wallet

**Step 1:** To get started, first install the [Maiar DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maiar-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm).

**Step 2:** Open up the extension and click on _‚Äò‚ÄôCreate new wallet‚Äù_.

**Step 3:** Next, a set of 24-secret phrases will be displayed. Safely backup these secret phrases. We strongly recommend you copy the phrases or write them down and store in a safe place like a password manager.  These phrases would be used to access your wallet and may not be retrieved.

**Step 4:** Before proceeding to the next step, confirm that you have safely stored your secret phrase.

**Step 5:** For further verification, you will be prompted to input some of the secret phrases.

**Step 6:** Create a password that will be used to access your wallet. Ensure you keep this password safe as it will be needed to access your wallet regularly and this password cannot be retrieved.

### Import existing wallet

Do you already have a wallet?

Then there is no need to create a new one. The Maiar Wallet Extension provides an option to import your existing wallet. However, to import an existing wallet, you must be able to access the¬†**recovery (secret) phrase**¬†of your wallet. 

The Maiar wallet has a set of 24-secret phrases, which serve as your wallet‚Äôs key. Using your secret phrase to import an existing wallet does not affect your wallet, as all transaction history across all networks will be reflected in the wallet extension.

**To get started:** 

**Step 1:** With the [Maiar DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maiar-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm) installed. Click on ‚Äò‚ÄôImport existing wallet‚Äù.

![maiar-defi-example-welcomepage](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step4.png)

**Step 2:** Next, enter your 24-word secret phrase. You can either enter these phrases one at a time or you can simply paste in the phrase using the "_paste_" icon.
