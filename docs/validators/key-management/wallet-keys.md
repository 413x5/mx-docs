As a Validator you use the Wallet Keys to access the address from which you send the staking transaction. Your eGold holdings leave this address and are deposited into a staking smart contract. Rewards are sent to this address. You can change it later on by using a `changeRewards` transaction. 



This wallet is the only one that can be used to send an un-stake transaction, meaning to recover your 2 500 EGLD from the staking smart contract.â€Œ

You can create a new Wallet Key at [https://wallet.elrond.com](https://wallet.elrond.com/). The resulting file(s) will have the default name `<wallet address>.json`, for example:

`erd13kgks9km5ky8vj2dfty79v769ej433k5xmyhzunk7fv4pndh7z2s8depqq.json`

You can rename the file to something easy to remember. You can retrieve the address from the file by editing it with a text editor. Open it and look for the `bech32` address, which always starts with `erd1...`
