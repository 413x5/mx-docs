title: Signing Providers for dApps
---

This page will guide you through the process of integrating the **erdjs signing providers** in a dApp which isn't based on `dapp-core`.

:::important
Note that for most purposes, **we recommend using [dapp-core](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/dapp-core)** instead of integrating the signing providers on your own.
:::

:::note
The code samples depicted on this page can also be found on the [erdjs examples repository](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-sdk-erdjs-examples).
