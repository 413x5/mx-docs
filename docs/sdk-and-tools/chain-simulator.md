## Overview

Chain simulator is a binary that provides all the `mx-chain-proxy-go` endpoints and includes additional endpoints 
for specific operations.


## Architectural Overview

This simulator is designed to replicate the behavior of a local testnet. Unlike a traditional testnet, this simulator
operates without a consensus group, allowing for isolated testing and development.
