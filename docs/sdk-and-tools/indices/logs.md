title: Elasticsearch index: logs

The `_id` field for this index is composed of hex-encoded hash of the transaction of the smart contract result that generated the log.

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| address        | The address field holds the address in a bech32 encoding. It can be the address of the smart contract that generated the log or the address of the receiver address of the transaction.                                     |
| events         | The events field holds a list of events.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| originalTxHash | The originalTxHash field holds the hex-encoded hash of the initial transaction. When this field is not empty the log is generated by a smart contract result and this field represents the hash of the initial transaction. |
| timestamp      | The timestamp field represents the timestamp of the block in which the log was generated.                                                                                                                                   |


Event structure 

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| identifier  | The identifier field represents the identifier of the event.                                                                                                                              |
| address     | The address field holds the address in a bech32 encoding. It can be the address of the smart contract that generated the event or the address of the receiver address of the transaction. |
| topics      | The topics field holds a list with extra information. They don't have a specific order because the smart contract is free to log anything that could be helpful.                          |
| data        | The data field can contain information added by the smart contract that generates the event.                                                                                              |
| order       | The order field represents the index of the event indicating the execution order.                                                                                                         |


## Query examples

### Fetch all the logs generated by a transaction

```
curl --request GET \
  --url ${ES_URL}/logs/_search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"query": {
		"match": {
			"_id":"d6.."
		}
	}
}'
```

## Query examples

### Fetch all the logs generated by a transaction(also with the ones that were generated by transaction's smart contract results)

```
curl --request GET \
  --url ${ES_URL}/logs/_search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"query": {
		"bool": {
			"should": [
				{
				     "match": {
                       "_id":"d6.."
                     }
				},
				{
					"match": {
						"originalTxHash": "d6.."
					}
				}
			]
